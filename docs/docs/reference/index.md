title: Overview
---

This section of the documentation contains the API reference for all the official packages under the `@auth/*` and `@next-auth/*` scopes.

:::warning Warning
The API reference is being migrated from the [old documentation page](https://next-auth.js.org), so there are going to be references to `next-auth` still. We are continuously working on updating the naming/references.

## Roadmap

Here are the _currently_ planned and released packages under the `@auth/*` scope. This is not an exhaustive list, but the set of packages that we would like to focus on to begin with.

| Feature             | Status       |
| ------------------- | ------------ |
| `@auth/nextjs`      | Planned      |
| `@auth/*-adapter`   | Planned      |
| `@auth/core`        | Experimental |
| `@auth/sveltekit`   | Experimental |
| `@auth/solid-start` | Experimental |

### Community Packages

While we are migrating the documentation and working on stabilizing the core package, the community has been working on some packages that are already available. With collaboration, we hope to make these packages official in the future.

:::note
If you are a maintainer of a package, [reach out](https://twitter.com/balazsorban44) if you want to collaborate on making it official or open a PR to add it to the list below, so others can discover it more easily.
